## The purpose of this repository

- This repository is prepared as the supplementary material with the paper titled "Dynamics of the accelerated t-SNE".
- The paper introduces Momentum methods (MM) and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) to the t-SNE algorithm with the solution functions of ordinary differential equations such as exponential functions or (modified) Bessel functions of the first kind. MM and NAG can be interpreted as an extention of Gradient Descent (GD) method.
